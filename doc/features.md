# Features and Limitations

## Features
- Can stamp a specified logo.
	Logo path can be relative to the path of the current blender file. It must then start with //

- Support also intergrated Blender Metadata (= text is moved if metadata are used)

## Limitations

- The layout for the text and information stamped on the framed image is currenly better fitted for 16:9 ratio.
Other ratios may produce unpredictable results. We have consideration for that issue for the future.
