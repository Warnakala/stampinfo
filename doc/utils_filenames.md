## Utils_filenames

The file [stampinfo/utils/utils_filenames.py](../stampinfo/utils/utils_filenames.py) contains a set of very useful functions to
store the path and name of a media file and to easily retrives some parts of its filepath. In particular, in the case of a
sequence of images, it can isolate the pattern of the name or the name of an image at a given frame.
